The scenario


In this scenario, you are a junior data analyst working for a hotel booking company. You have been asked to
clean a .csv file that was created after querying a database to combine two different tables from different
hotels. In order to learn more about this data, you are going to need to use functions to preview the dataâ€™s
structure, including its columns and rows. You will also need to use basic cleaning functions to prepare this
data for analysis.
